## Payment Failure
Subject: Trouble Funding Stripe

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the heads‑up. A payment attempt can fail if the bank needs extra verification or the card has a restriction. Please try again in Billing & Payments and, if possible, use a different card. If the issue persists, share the timestamp and the last 4 digits of the card so we can check the Stripe logs.
